Project Goals:
Use R to import the data and to answer the following questions.  Each question should have supporting R code and output for its answer.  The preferred format for the output will be an R Markdown document, either in HTML or PDF format.  The final product should be pushed out to the team leaderâ€™s Github repository.
(a)    Approximately how many occupied square feet does each property have?

(b)    Sort the shopping malls by occupied square footage.  Which shopping malls are the five largest by this measure?

(c)     Consider malls that are enclosed versus those that are open air.  Which type of mall is larger, on average?  Provide a calculation in support of your answer.

(d)    Create a categorical variable in the tibble that is called LargeMall, which takes one value when a mall is either enclosed and larger than 1000000 SF, or open air and larger than 500000 SF.

(e)    How much total money (in thousands) is still owed on open air properties, compared with those that are enclosed?

(f)      What is the median size of a Washington Prime Group property in each of the states?  Calculate this measure separately for each state.

(g)    Create a tibble that displays only properties that have an outstanding mortgage principal balance, and only displays the property name, its state, and its outstanding mortgage balance.

(h)    From this tibble, how much money is owed on mortgage balances for properties in each of the states?
